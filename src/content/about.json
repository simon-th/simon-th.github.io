    "Hi! My name is Simon and Iâ€™m a recently graduated software engineer based in Austin, TX. I love building solutions to complex problems, and I love learning as much as I can in the process. I am currently working as a Software Engineer at Amazon, where I work on building cloud-native, highly scalable software to improve safety for thousands of Amazon employees around the globe.",
    "I recently graduated from UT Austin, where I had the opportunity to conduct research on a neural network compression model, teach the fundamentals of software to underclassmen, and work on some really cool projects ranging from reinforcement learning to web development. I also spent a summer at Amazon building a data pipeline and learning all about AWS.",
    "I work on this website in my spare time, partly to showcase my work, but mostly to learn more about React, Docker, and all the cool things that they can do!"
